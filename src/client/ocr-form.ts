/**
 * Staged form model behind the ocr configuration card.
 *
 * A card stages what the user types and writes it only when they save. Each
 * settings write is a durable, revision-fenced document mutation, so a
 * control that committed as it settled turned one edit into a write the user
 * never asked for and could not preview; staged text makes what is on screen
 * exactly what a save would store.
 *
 * A field shows its effective value — the user layer over the composition
 * layer over the schema default — and whether the user layer carries it. That
 * presence, not a value comparison, is what marks a field overridden: an
 * override equal to the composition default is still an override.
